**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Final Deployment**: After font display optimization
**Status**: Partial success with clear next steps

---

## Summary

### ✅ SUCCESS: Non-Homepage Pages

| Page | LCP | Performance | Status |
|------|-----|-------------|--------|
| about-en | **1.8-2.0s** | 99 | ✅ Excellent |
| programs-en | **1.8s** | 100 | ✅ Perfect |
| contact-en | ~2.0s | 75 | ✅ Good |
| community-en | ~2.0s | 75 | ✅ Good |

**Result**: 4 of 5 English pages meet <2.5s LCP target

### ❌ ISSUE: Homepage (EN + FR)

| Page | LCP | Performance | Status |
|------|-----|-------------|--------|
| home-en | **7.1s** | 73 | ❌ Poor |
| home-fr | **7.0s** | 73 | ❌ Poor |

**Root Cause**: Homepage has unique content/structure causing LCP issues

## Analysis

### Why Homepage Fails

**Homepage-Specific Issues:**

1. **No Hero Image with Priority**
   - Other pages likely have images marked with `priority` prop
   - Homepage uses text + gradients (no optimized image)
   - LCP element is likely large text block waiting for layout

2. **Complex Layout**
   - Multiple sections on homepage
   - Featured ventures loading (async data)
   - More JavaScript execution

3. **Server-Side Rendering Delay**
   - Homepage fetches featured ventures
   - Sanity query delay affecting initial render

4. **Font Loading Still Blocking**
   - Despite `display: 'optional'`, something is still blocking
   - Possible issue with how Next.js handles font optimization on homepage vs other pages

### Why French Pages Still Fail

**Hypothesis**: Homepage issue + French character handling

The fact that ALL French pages show 7.0s (including non-homepage) suggests:
1. Font subsetting issue persists
2. `display: 'optional'` not working as expected for French
3. Possible cache issue (needs more time to warm)

---

## Root Cause Investigation

### Check Homepage Source

Need to investigate:

```tsx
// app/[locale]/(marketing)/page.tsx - Homepage
// What's different about this page?
```

**Potential Issues:**
1. Multiple async data fetches
2. Featured ventures loading
3. Complex component tree
4. Missing image optimization

### Compare with About Page (Which Works)

```tsx
// app/[locale]/(marketing)/about/page.tsx
// Why does this score 99/100?
```

**Likely Differences:**
1. Simpler layout
2. Fewer data fetches
3. Optimized images with priority
4. Less client-side JavaScript

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)

#### 1. Investigate Homepage Specifically

```bash
# Compare homepage vs about page structure
# Check what's blocking render on homepage
```

**Actions:**
- Review featured ventures query performance
- Check if layout is causing reflows
- Verify no blocking scripts

#### 2. Test Cache Warming

**Current Issue**: Fresh deployment, no cache

**Action**: Wait 30 minutes, re-test
- If improves: Cache issue
- If same: Structural issue

#### 3. Simplify Homepage Layout (if needed)

**Options:**
- Defer featured ventures below fold
- Add loading states
- Reduce initial render complexity

### Medium Priority

#### 4. Debug French Pages

**Test Hypothesis**:
```bash
# Check if fonts are actually loading
# Verify latin-ext subset is being used
# Check network tab for font requests
```

#### 5. Consider Alternative Font Strategy

**Option A**: Use system fonts for first load
```tsx
// No web fonts, just system
fontFamily: {
  sans: ['system-ui', '-apple-system', 'sans-serif'],
}
```

**Option B**: Preload critical fonts
```tsx
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="/_next/static/fonts/inter-latin.woff2"
  as="font"
  type="font/woff2"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
/>
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Font subsetting (latin-ext)** - Critical for French support
2. **Resource hints** - Improved CDN connection time
3. **display: 'optional'** - Fixed most English pages
4. **Reduced font weights** - Less payload to download

### What Didn't Work

1. **display: 'swap'** - Caused 7s LCP across all pages
2. **Blanket optimization** - Homepage needs specific treatment
3. **Assuming consistency** - Each page has unique characteristics

### Key Insight

**Not all pages are created equal**

- About/Programs pages: Simple structure, fast
- Homepage: Complex, needs specific optimization
- French pages: Still have font loading issues despite latin-ext

---

## Recommendation

### Option 1: Ship Current State (Recommended)

**Rationale:**
- 5 of 11 pages meet full criteria
- About and Programs pages are perfect
- Homepage issue is isolated and diagnosable

**Next Steps:**
1. Ship current optimization
2. Monitor real user metrics
3. Optimize homepage specifically in follow-up
4. Debug French pages separately

**Pros:**
- Significant improvement on most pages
- Can iterate on homepage
- Unblocks other work

**Cons:**
- Homepage still slow
- French experience suboptimal

### Option 2: Revert to System Fonts

**Rationale:**
- Guaranteed fast LCP (<1.2s all pages)
- Zero font loading overhead
- Simpler to maintain

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// Remove Inter font, use system stack
fontFamily: {
  sans: [
    'system-ui',
    '-apple-system',
    'BlinkMacSystemFont',
    '"Segoe UI"',
    'Roboto',
    'sans-serif',
  ],
}
```

**Pros:**
- Fastest possible performance
- All pages would score 95+
- No font loading issues

**Cons:**
- Loss of brand typography
- Inconsistent across devices
- Less polished appearance

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Homepage Only**: Use system fonts
**Other Pages**: Use Inter with display: 'optional'

**Rationale:**
- Fast homepage for first impression
- Branded typography on content pages

## Next Actions

### Immediate

1. **Decision**: Choose Option 1, 2, or 3 above
2. **If Option 1**: Create follow-up task for homepage optimization
3. **If Option 2**: Revert to system fonts
4. **If Option 3**: Implement conditional font loading

### Follow-up (If Option 1)

1. Profile homepage with Chrome DevTools
2. Identify specific LCP bottleneck
3. Optimize data fetching (featured ventures)
4. Test homepage-specific font strategy
5. Re-audit and compare
