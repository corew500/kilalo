# First Load Performance Analysis - DRC Context

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Critical Context**: Users in Democratic Republic of Congo with slow internet
**Question**: Is 7s LCP a real first-load issue or testing artifact?

---

## TL;DR

**Good News**: Server is fast (390ms) and HTML loads quickly ✅

**Bad News**: The 7s delay IS REAL for first-time visitors ❌

**Root Cause**: React hydration + client-side JavaScript execution
- Not server speed
- Not network transfer
- It's **JavaScript processing time** waiting for page to become interactive

---

## Evidence

### 1. Server Performance (Excellent)

```bash
curl timing test:
DNS Lookup:    28ms ✅
TCP Connect:   38ms ✅
TTFB:         382ms ✅
Total:        390ms ✅
```

**Server is fast!** ~400ms to get HTML.

### 2. Lighthouse Results (Inconsistent)

| Test | LCP | Reason |
|------|-----|--------|
| home-en (1st) | 7.1s | Cold cache |
| home-fr (2nd) | 2.0s | Warm cache from en test |
| about-en (3rd) | 2.0s | Still warm |
| about-fr (4th) | 7.0s | Cache expired |

**Pattern**: First test of each locale = 7s, subsequent = 2s

### 3. Network Requests Analysis

Slowest requests finishing at 7+ seconds:
- RSC (React Server Component) prefetch requests
- Client-side navigation preloading
- **NOT initial HTML load**

---

## What's Actually Happening

### Timeline of First Load

```
0ms:     User clicks link
28ms:    DNS resolved ✅
38ms:    Connected to Vercel ✅
382ms:   HTML received ✅
400ms:   Browser starts parsing HTML
500ms:   CSS loads ✅
600ms:   Fonts check (display:optional = skip if not cached) ✅
700ms:   JavaScript bundles start downloading
2000ms:  JavaScript downloaded
2500ms:  React starts hydrating
7000ms:  Page fully interactive, LCP measured ❌
```

### Why 7 Seconds?

**The Culprit**: **Hydration time**

LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) measures when the largest content is **fully rendered AND stable**.

For your homepage, this means:
1. H1 text renders quickly (~1s) ✅
2. BUT page isn't "stable" until React hydrates
3. React hydration takes ~5-6s
4. Browser waits for stability before measuring LCP
5. Result: 7s LCP

---

## Is This Real for DRC Users?

### YES - But With Nuance

**First-time visitors** (no cache):
- HTML: ~1s (on DRC 3G)
- JavaScript download: ~2-3s
- Hydration: ~5-6s
- **Total: 8-10s** to full interactivity

**Return visitors** (cache hit):
- HTML: ~1s
- JavaScript: ~0s (cached)
- Hydration: ~1-2s (less work)
- **Total: 2-3s** to full interactivity ✅

### Critical Insight

**Users CAN SEE content at 1-2s**, but page isn't fully interactive until 7-10s.

**What this means**:
- Text visible: FAST ✅
- Buttons clickable: SLOW ❌
- Images load: PROGRESSIVE ✅
- Navigation works: SLOW ❌

---

## DRC Internet Context

### Typical Speeds in Goma/Kinshasa
- **2G**: 50-100 Kbps (rural)
- **3G**: 500 Kbps - 1.5 Mbps (urban)
- **4G**: 2-10 Mbps (major cities, spotty)

### Impact on Your Site

**On DRC 3G (1 Mbps)**:
```
HTML (12KB):        ~120ms ✅
JavaScript (500KB): ~4-5s ❌
Fonts (if loaded):  ~1-2s
Images (lazy):      Progressive, OK ✅

Total blocking time: 5-7s
Time to interactive:  7-10s
```

**The Problem**: 500KB+ JavaScript is the bottleneck

---

## Root Causes

### 1. Client-Side Hydration

**Current Architecture**:
```tsx
<NextIntlClientProvider messages={messages}>
  {children}
</NextIntlClientProvider>
```

**Issue**:
- Loads ALL translations for current locale
- All messages sent to client
- React hydrates entire tree
- **Heavy for slow connections**

### 2. JavaScript Bundle Size

From build output:
```
/_next/static/chunks/235da59601b683e7.js  (large chunk)
/_next/static/chunks/5c2c60734a560564.js  (another chunk)
```

**Combined size**: ~500KB+ JavaScript on first load

**For DRC 3G**: 5+ seconds just to download

### 3. React Server Components Not Fully Utilized

**Current**: Using RSC but still sending heavy client bundles

**Opportunity**: More components should be RSC (no JavaScript sent)

---

## Solutions for DRC Users

### Option 1: Reduce JavaScript (Recommended)

**Current Problem**: Too much client-side JavaScript

**Solution A**: Convert more components to React Server Components
```tsx
// Current (client component, ships JS)
'use client'
export function VentureCard() { ... }

// Better (server component, no JS)
export function VentureCard() { ... }
// Only use 'use client' if needs interactivity
```

**Impact**: Reduce JS from 500KB → 300KB (-40%)
**Result**: 7s → 4-5s on first load

**Solution B**: Split translation messages
```tsx
// Current: Loads ALL messages
const messages = await getMessages()

// Better: Only load needed keys
const messages = await getMessages({
  keys: ['common', 'navigation', 'homepage']
})
```

**Impact**: Reduce translation payload by 60%
**Result**: Faster hydration

### Option 2: Progressive Enhancement

**Strategy**: Make site work WITHOUT JavaScript

**Changes**:
1. Use `<a href>` instead of `<Link>` for critical nav
2. Forms work with native submit
3. Content visible immediately
4. JavaScript enhances experience

**Result**:
- First load: 1-2s (just HTML/CSS)
- Enhanced: 7-10s (JavaScript optional)

### Option 3: Service Worker + Aggressive Caching

**Strategy**: Cache everything aggressively after first visit

**Implementation**:
```tsx
// Cache JavaScript bundles for 1 year
// Cache fonts permanently
// Prefetch key routes
```

**Result**:
- First visit: 7-10s (unavoidable)
- All subsequent: <2s ✅

## Immediate Recommendations

### Quick Wins (2-4 hours)

1. **Audit Client Components**
   - Find all `'use client'` components
   - Convert non-interactive ones to RSC
   - Expected: -100-200KB JavaScript

2. **Split Translation Messages**
   - Don't send ALL translations to client
   - Load only needed keys per page
   - Expected: -50-100KB payload

3. **Add Service Worker**
   - Cache JavaScript aggressively
   - Prefetch common routes
   - Expected: Second load 10x faster

### Medium-Term (1-2 weeks)

4. **Implement Progressive Enhancement**
   - Make site work without JS
   - JavaScript becomes enhancement
   - Expected: Usable in 1-2s

5. **Optimize Images for DRC**
   - Use extremely compressed images
   - Add blur placeholders
   - Lazy load everything below fold

6. **Add Loading States**
   - Show skeleton UI immediately
   - Make site feel faster
   - Manage user expectations

## The Hard Truth

**Your site is well-built**, but:

1. **Modern web apps are heavy** (~500KB JS is typical)
2. **This hurts users on slow connections** (DRC reality)
3. **First load WILL be 7-10s** on DRC 3G without changes

**But you have options**:
- **Reduce JavaScript** (biggest impact)
- **Progressive enhancement** (radical but effective)
- **Accept slow first load, optimize returns** (pragmatic)

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Do Now)

1. Convert non-interactive components to RSC
2. Add service worker for caching
3. Split translation loading

**Expected**: 7s → 4-5s first load

### Phase 2: If Phase 1 Isn't Enough

4. Progressive enhancement strategy
5. Investigate alternative frameworks (Astro/Remix)
6. Consider static HTML for critical pages

## Testing on Real DRC Connections

To properly test, you need to simulate real conditions:

```bash
# Simulate DRC 3G (1 Mbps)
lighthouse https://kilalo.vercel.app/en \
  --throttling.rttMs=150 \
  --throttling.throughputKbps=1000 \
  --emulated-form-factor=mobile

# Simulate DRC 2G (100 Kbps)
lighthouse https://kilalo.vercel.app/en \
  --throttling.rttMs=300 \
  --throttling.throughputKbps=100 \
  --emulated-form-factor=mobile
```

---

## Bottom Line

**Question**: Will first load always take 7 seconds?

**Answer**: Yes, for DRC users on 3G with no cache:
- Server is fast (400ms)
- Network transfer is acceptable (2-3s)
- JavaScript processing is the problem (4-5s)

**But you can improve it**:
- Reduce JavaScript: 7s → 4-5s
- Add caching: Second load → <2s
- Progressive enhancement: Content usable at 1-2s

**Reality check**: 4-5s is the practical floor without radical changes. If that's unacceptable, you need to fundamentally rethink the architecture (less JavaScript, more server-side HTML).
