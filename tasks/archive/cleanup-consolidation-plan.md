# Kilalo Documentation Cleanup & Consolidation Plan

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Purpose**: Restore original 14-phase structure, document completed work, create skills, and consolidate todo.md

---

## Analysis Summary

### Current State
- Original 14-phase structure from commit d0dbc2b (1054 lines)
- Current todo.md has 242 lines focused on recent testing work
- 6 completed task report files in tasks/ folder
- Translation audit showing 100% coverage achieved
- Testing infrastructure complete: 117 unit tests + 93 E2E executions
- 4 existing Claude skills in .claude/skills/

### Completed Work (Oct 28-29)
1. **Phase 4: Internationalization** - 100% complete (206 fields × 2 languages)
2. **Phase 6: Sanity CMS** - Integration complete with localized fields
3. **Phase 9: Testing** - Vitest + Playwright fully implemented
4. **Phase 11: Deployment** - Vercel deployment complete
5. **Production Readiness** - 95/100 score, build passing, 0 TypeScript errors

### Gaps Identified
- Missing comprehensive PHASES_COMPLETED.md documentation
- Missing consolidated TESTING.md guide
- Missing skills for vitest-testing, playwright-e2e, jsdoc-standards
- todo.md needs restructuring to show what's done vs what's left
- Implementation plan files can be archived

- [x] Read translation-audit-report.md
- [x] Read vitest-implementation-plan.md
- [x] Read playwright-e2e-plan.md

### 3. Create Documentation Files

#### docs/PHASES_COMPLETED.md
Document all completed phases with:
- Phase 1: Prerequisites & Account Setup
- Phase 2: Project Foundation Setup

- Coverage goals

### 4. Create Claude Skills

#### .claude/skills/vitest-testing.md
- When to use Vitest for unit tests
- Setup (vitest.config.ts, vitest.setup.ts)
- Mocking patterns (next-intl, Next/Image, Sanity)
- Example test structure from i18n-helpers.test.ts
- Running tests (npm test, npm test:ui, npm test:coverage)
- Best practices

#### .claude/skills/playwright-e2e.md
- When to use Playwright for E2E tests
- Setup (playwright.config.ts)
- Test patterns (locale switching, navigation, Sanity data)
- Selector strategies (getByRole, aria-labels)
- Running tests (npm run test:e2e, test:e2e:ui)
- Browser configuration
- Best practices

#### .claude/skills/jsdoc-standards.md
- JSDoc documentation standards for this project
- Required tags (@param, @returns, @example)
- Style guide
- Examples from lib/i18n-helpers.ts and lib/sanity-helpers.ts
- When to document
- TypeScript integration

### 5. Write Clean Consolidated todo.md

Structure:
```markdown
# Kilalo Project - Todo List
**Last Updated**: [DATE]
**Status**: Active Development

## Current Project Status
- Completed phases summary
- Quick stats
- Links to detailed docs

## COMPLETED PHASES
- Phase 1-3 (summaries with links)
- Phase 4: i18n
- Phase 6: Sanity
- Phase 9: Testing
- Phase 11: Deployment

## IN PROGRESS
- Phase 7: Content Implementation
- Phase 10: Performance Optimization

## TODO - PRIORITY ORDER

### HIGH PRIORITY
- Phase 7 content completion
- Phase 10 audits
- Documentation JSDoc

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Phase 5: Supabase (NOT STARTED)
- Phase 8: Member Portal (NOT STARTED)

### LOW PRIORITY
- Phase 12-14

## Documentation References
- Links to all docs

## Development Skills
- Links to all .claude/skills
```

### 6. Cleanup tasks/ Folder

Archive these files to tasks/archive/:
- vitest-implementation-plan.md
- playwright-e2e-plan.md
- quality-and-testing-plan.md

Keep in tasks/:
- todo.md (new consolidated version)
- phase-10-production-readiness-report.md
- playwright-e2e-implementation-report.md
- translation-audit-report.md
